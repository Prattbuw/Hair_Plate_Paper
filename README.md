# Hair_Plate_Paper
Code repository for Pratt et al., 2025

This repository contains code to analyze walking kinematics of CxHP8 silenced flies on a treadmill, joint angle encoding properties of CxHP8 neurons, optogenetic silencing and activation kinematic effects of CxHP8 neurons, and hair plate connectivity in motor circuits in fruit flies.

Datasets used in the following analyses are located at this Dryad repository:

3D walking kinematics (intraleg kinematics and interleg coordination) and resting posture of flies on a treadmill were analyzed and visualized using the following Jupyter notebooks:
- "treadmill_analysis.ipynb"
- "treadmill_visualization.ipynb"

Joint angle encoding properties of CxHP8 neurons and activity of CxHP8 neurons during behavior were obtained through calcium imaging and characterized using the following Jupyter notebooks:
- "calcium_imaging_analysis.ipynb"
- "analyze_calcium_signals_during_behavior.ipynb"

The kinematic and behavioral effects of optogenetic activation and silencing of CxHP8 neurons were characterized using the following Jupyter notebooks:
- "optogentics_analysis.ipynb"
- "heuristic_grooming_classifier.ipynb"

Finally, connectomic analysis of hair plate connectivity with motor neurons was assessed using this Jupyter notebook:
- "connectome_analysis.ipynb"
